# LF radio OOK transmitter

This is a receiver I plan to use with my [receiver](rx.md). The result should be an OOK tx/rx pair 

</br>

Considerations:

- I need a good design for the transmitter. It should feature a simple fixed frequency oscillator and optionally if the signal is too week an amplifier made with the lowest count of parts possible and possibly based around a simple NPN transistor (2N2222)

- I need components in order to make this projects. I might consider buying them when I have a nice design.

- I need a scope to debug the circuit. The oscillator resonant frequency need to be checked with it.

- When the frequency is determined precisely the title of this and the receiver posts should be updated to match it.

- This and the receiver posts should be fitted in the indexing scheme of the final container of this blog together. Solutions might be: keeping the posts separate and adding to the indexing system index exclusion list and overrides, grouping the content of the posts together in one post

This is a nice design but it makes use of a crystal and I currently don't understand it fully:
