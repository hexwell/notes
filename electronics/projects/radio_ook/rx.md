# LF radio OOK receiver

This is the receiver i plan to use with my [transmitter](tx.md)

As soon as the transmitter frequency is determined I should be able to build this receiver.

The design might be inspired by:

## Notes on these designs

The circuit shown in "youtube 2" (ANT -||- N, GND ->|- N, N ->| OUT, GND -||- OUT) is just a rectifier to harvest the maximum power out of RF (whatever frequency) but it actually loses some of the signal via the diodes (best case .7 V  with germanium diodes). I am becoming convinced that it is not useful for this project and the design of "youtube 1" is basically all that I need.
