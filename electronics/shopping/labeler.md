# Labeler

My choice for a labeler is: Brother PT-H110

My main concern with a labeler is it's ability to print the omega symbol for resistors labels. Another concern raised by Andreas Spiess in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/QnNqlC5CydE?t=558) (9:18 - 10:12) is the price of cartridges. It requires further investigation
