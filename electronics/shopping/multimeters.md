# Multimeters

Multimeters can have, ranked by importance:

Must have:
- Voltage measuring
- Current measuring
- Resistance measuring
- Continuity testing

Very useful:
- Capacitance measuring

Nice additions:
- Auto range
- Min/Max functions for voltage, current and frequency
- Frequency counting
- Inductance measuring

Rarely used:
- Transistor gain measuring

</br>

The ranking rationale of the first items is obvious, the last ones are there because for inductance the methods referred to in the [measuring inductance link] can be used and very few meters have the setting and for transistor testing a component tester is often easier, more practical and gives nicer more complete results (although it's better to refer to the datasheet for higher accuracy)

</br>

My choice based on all this factor and price is a: UNI-T UT202A+ (30 â‚¬)
